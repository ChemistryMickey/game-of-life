# Project Kuzco

## Requirements:
- Write Conrad's Game of Life
    - Shall include visualization
    - Shall include way of inputting starting conditions
    - Shall be written in Go (I've never used Golang prior to this project)
- Learn EVERYTHING (viz, Go, etc.) just using Meta's codellama:13b (NO GOOGLING except when sanity is at stake)

## Goals:
- Learn Go
- Evaluate programmatic truthiness of solo LLM

## Conclusion:
Did I learn go? Kinda not really.
Missing out on a lot of the foundational stuff.
I'm not sure how memory works adn this wasn't complex enough to involve anything more sophisticated.

Not too bad but the LLM was really bad at returning functional code or suddenly throwing up way too much absurdly erroneous code.

That being said, I got some basic "error as values", JSON parsing/serialization, object orientation, etc.
So all 'n all, not terrible.
I wouldn't claim to know that much Go after this though.
Clearly missed a lot of basic things like type coersion, parsing strings, networking, etc.
But this project was also never designed with that in mind.

So... Mission Accomplished!...?
